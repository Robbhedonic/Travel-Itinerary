# Travel Itinerary 

A collaborative CLI application for planning trips, managing activities, and tracking travel expenses.

## About

This project helps travelers organize their journey by creating trip itineraries with detailed activities and budget tracking. Built as a team project to practice TypeScript, asynchronous programming, and collaborative development workflows.
